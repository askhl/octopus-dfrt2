	* bravais_art.c:

	Hexagonal to Orthorhombic symmetry lowering case is implemented.

	* python module:

	Python module is implemented. To use them, numpy is
	required. Interface for ASE is implemented.

	* bravais_art.c:

	This file is used for the cases that the lattice has higher
	symmetry than the symmetry given by atomic positions. This does
	not affect to the symmetry operations that is firstly obtained by
	assuming the bravais lattice having high symmetry. Thus this file
	works only for changing its bravais lattice. The information about
	bravais lattice is used for only determing space group. Even if
	the code in this file fails, or let's say, space group
	determination fails), we can not say the symmetry operations are
	wrong.

	* Most of the code

	The procedure for searching a Bravais lattice from a primitive
	cell is rewritten. The algorithm is also totally changed.

	* test directory

	For the test of space group search, 'test' directory is
	created. Many POSCAR's are prepared in this directory. For running
	tests, a small ruby code is written and put into this directory.

	* spacegroup_data.c (get_spacegroup_data_special_case):

	Bug fix for space group determinations for special cases (Pcc2,
	Pbam, Pccn).

2008-05-25  Atsushi Togo  <togo.atsushi@gmail.com>

	* *.c, *.h :
	
	Many codes are re-built. Many functions are changed to
	"static". The first three characters of public functions are
	re-named using those file names.

	* bravais.c :

	Monoclinic is possibly improved. Monoclinic is difficult. It may
	contain further bugs...

	* spacegroup.c (get_proper_rotation_class_6axis):

	exit(1) is inserted.

	* bravais.c/h:

	"lattice_symmetry" is removed from the "Bravais" structure.

	* spglib.h: 

	Misspelled function prototypes of spg_get_symmetry and
	spg_check_symmetry are corrected.

	* Many patches by Xavier Andrade

	For fixing many warning in many codes and gcc-4.3 related problem
	in bravais.c.
