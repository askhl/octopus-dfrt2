########################### Begin user-configurable parameters ########################
## This file is generated by configure and contains all the user-configurable parameters.
## Typically, a user should not have to set these parameters in this file; use configure
## to do so [configure --help gives you the configure switches; look towards the end]
## All the makefiles in the directories below  include this file, and hence get
## all the configurations. There is no need to hack the individual Makefiles in the
## directories below.

# Where is the zoltan library kept ? what architecture is it ?

# Where is the CCA specification kept, specifically the MakeIncl.CCA_Component file.
# All the specification headers are defined in CCA_INC, which is defined in MakeIncl.CCA_Component.
# All makefiles for components need to include MakeIncl.CCA_Component.
CCA_MAKEINCL_DIR = @CCA_MAKEINCL_DIR@


# Where is the framework kept ? Certain "features" like parameter objects are still not
# a part of the specification and need to come in from the framework. This will disappear
# soon. Need to know where the framework library is and where the parameter headers are

# Where is the MPI kept so that I can use mpi.h ?  !!Both the framework and Zoltan should
# be compiled against the same MPI !!

# Where are the ZoltanPorts kept ? Should be in this package, unless they have been
# merged with a global repository of Ports elsewhere.

# components for testing (Driver and Mesh) kept ?
