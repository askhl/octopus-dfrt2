# The Larmor frequency is given by w = (e*Bz)/(m*c), where
# e is the electronic charge (1 in a.u.), m is the electronic
# mass (1 in a.u.) and c is the speed of light. Therefore
# the period of the precession is (2*pi*m*c)/(e*Bz). We run
# until 1/4 of the period, so that <Sx> goes to zero, and 
# <Sy> goes to 1/2.

# P_c is the speed of light in atomic units.
