=head1 NAME

oct-propagation_spectrum - Calculates the absorption cross-section tensor from a time-propagation run.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=over

=item B<oct-propagation_spectrum>

=back

[oct-propagation_spectrum does not read the standard input: all standard input
will be simply ignored. An input file named F<inp> must be present
in the running directory.
Also, oct-propagation_spectrum accepts no command-line arguments, since there is
not a standard way to do this with Fortran 90.]


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program is one of the B<octopus> utilities.

It uses the response of the system to a kick to the density, in a time-propagation run (CalculationMode = td),
to calculate a spectrum of the absorption cross-section.

The man pages of octopus and of the auxiliary octopus
sub-programs (oct-something) are not intended to contain the
documentation of the programs, but only their basic
description. For where to find more documentation, see the
L<SEE ALSO> section below.
