# Calculation of the excitations of the Nitrogen molecule within the
# linear-response TDDFT formalism -- linear response in the frequency
# domain via the so-called "Casida equations".
#
# The calculation attempts to reproduce the numbers given in:
# [T. Grabo, M. Petersilka and E.K.U. Gross, J. Mol. Structure THEOCHEM
#  501-502, 353 (2000)].
# The ground-state KS eigenvalues coincide fairly well with the
# given in Table I (column labeled "xcLDA"), whereas the excitations
# coincide also (to within some error) with the numbers given in
# Table II.
# (Note that since the calculation is spin-restricted, it misses all
# the spin-triplet excitations. So the first excitations reported
# in the lrtddft_casida/casida file correspond with the [a^1 \Pi_g],
# [a'^1\Sigma_u^-] and [w^1\Delta_u] states.)
#
# The differences may be due to the pseudopotential, or to differences
# in the Casida-matrix truncation.
# Also note that, to speed up the calculation, it is not fully
# converged, especially with respect to the size of the simulation box.
#
# The numbers given in this paper are also very similar to the ones
# presented in the "seminal" work:
# [C. Jamorski, M. E. Casida and D. R. Salahub, J. Chem. Phys. 104,
#  5134 (1996)].
# The calculations reported in this paper, however, are affected by
# the basis-set truncation error, and because of this are difficult
# to compare.
