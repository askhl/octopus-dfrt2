To get the octopus source code issue this svn command:

 svn co http://www.tddft.org/svn/octopus/branches/3.2.x octopus

The source must be in a directory called "octopus" in the root of 
octopus directory of this benchmark suite, i.e., this directory.

octopus requires GSL, so you'll need to be sure that the system
has GSL installed and that compile.xml has the correct info about
the location of this library.

During the nbench-* runs, octopus might complain that it will waste
too much computer time and refuse to run. This is due to a "severe"
"mismatch" between the number of parallel tasks octopus can do and
the number of nodes it will run on. If you want to optimize the
node assignment, please bear in mind that the ideal node number
for benchmark "c240" is a 530*2**n with n a (small) positive or 
negative integer and for benchmark "chlorophyll" this number is 
880*2**n.
