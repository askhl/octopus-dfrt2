This directory (TestSuite) will contain components which will be used
to run the same set of tests that Zoltan has in ../Zoltan/test. 
The general architecture is 
		_________________________
_____________  |      _____________      !  ___________
!            !-|     !             !     !--!          !
!   Driver   !-------! Partitioner !--------! Mesh     !
!	     !       !             !        !          !
-------------        --------------         -----------

The Mesh will contain the mesh representation and will liberally
use the code in ../Zoltan/driver and ../Zoltan/ch since the 
problems in ../Zoltan/test have meshes stored in Chaco & Nemesis 
formats which i will not bother to learn. This dependence on 
Zoltan code is entirely a function of having to use Chaco and 
Nemesis-format meshes; if you have your own mesh, write a Mesh
component of your own and be free.

The Driver too has ../Zoltan/driver dependencies since it reads in a 
command file to determine some Zoltan-specific parameters. It also
sets this cmd file name on Mesh, so that Mesh can get access to some
parallel i/o info, again needed for chaco or nemesis file readers.
