CHEESE SPAETZLE:

Ingredients: For 4 persons
  - 500 grs. of flour
  - 5 eggs
  - 1/8 ltrs. of water
  - 2 onions
  - 2 cloves of garlic
  - 200 grs. of cream
  - 250 grs. of grated Emmentaler
  - salt, pepper

Tools:
  - Spaetzle board
  - Spaetzle grater

Preparation: Mix a pasty dough with the flour, eggs, and water (use a
mixer if available, otherwise ask someone to take turns...). Take a
medium sized pot, fill with water, add some salt, and bring to a
boil. Grate small portions of the dough into the boiling water (see
drawing below, don't give up too early, it needs some practise). Take
them out after the Spaetzle swim at the surface. Put them in a bowl
with some water and keep them warm in the oven. Continue with the rest
of the dough. Note: the water has to be boiling all the time. Cut the
garlic into tiny cubes, and mix them with cream, salt, and pepper. Put
alternating layers of Spaetzle and cheese in a casserole, pour the
cream on top, and put it into the oven at about 150 C for 20
minutes. Cut the onions into half rings and fry them slowly until they
are brown. Garnish the Cheese Spaetzle with the fried onions and
enjoy. (You should take white whine with this dish.)
