=head1 NAME

octopus - Ab-initio Time-dependent Electronic Structure.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=over

=item B<octopus>

=back

[octopus no longer reads the standard input (this causes
trouble to many MPI implementations). All standard input
will be simply ignored. An input file named F<inp> must be present
in the running directory.
Also, octopus accepts no command-line arguments, since there is
not a standard way to do this with Fortran 90.]


=head1 DESCRIPTION

octopus is a program aimed at ab initio virtual
experimentation on electron/ion dynamics in external
electromagnetic fields of arbitrary intensity, shape
and frequency in a hopefully ever increasing range of
system types.

The man pages of octopus and of the auxiliary octopus
sub-programs (oct-something) are not intended to contain the
documentation of the programs, but only their basic
description. For where to find more documentation, see the
L<SEE ALSO> section below.
