# Script to use gnuplot to plot the partitioning of
# the mesh.
# The files mesh_partition.??? as produced in debug/mesh_partition by
# the octopus debug mode have to be present in the current working
# directory when this script is invoked.
# The plot can be found in the file mesh_partitions.png.
# This script generates a gnuplot-script called mesh_partitions_index.gp
# which is stored in the current working directory and can be loaded into
# gnuplot manually.
# With
#
#   gnuplot> load mesh_partitions_index.gp
#   gnuplot> set term x11
#   gnuplot> replot
#
# the plot can be reproduced and shown on the screen so that
# rotating and zooming is possible.
#

# Output files.
