This directory contains a postprocessing tool to compare ordering
quality of different algorithms.

At this time, we can compare Scotch and ParMetis ordering, produced by
using Zoltan ordering interface, calling from zdrive.
Now, to work, you have to :
 - have a zdrive linked with Scotch, make ZOLTAN_ARCH=linux64scotch zdrive
 - have a zdrive linked with ParMetis, make ZOLTAN_ARCH=linux64 zdrive
 - have the order_eval executable : make ZOLTAN_ARCH=linux64scotch order_eval

To run, you have to create two directories : "logs" and "results"

Example, order simple.mtx with 2, 4 and 8 processors and see the
 different steps
$ ./ordering.py -r 2-8 ../../test/hg_simple/simple.mtx -v

Contents of directory:
 - mm_input.[ch] : MatrixMarket input processing for order_eval tool
 - order_eval.[ch] : Ordering evaluation tool, from scotch.
 - ordering.py: Main script
 - toscotchperm.py: make the ordering outputs compatible with order_eval
 - README: this file
 - zdrive.inp: describe how to do ordering for zdrive
