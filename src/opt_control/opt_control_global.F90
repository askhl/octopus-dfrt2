    !%Description
    !% Optimal Control Theory can be performed with <tt>Octopus</tt> with a variety of different
    !% algorithms. Not all of them can be used with any choice of target or control function
    !% representation. For example, some algorithms cannot be used if

    !% (<tt>OCTScheme</tt> .gt. <tt>oct_algorithm_straight_iteration</tt>), and others cannot be used 
    !% if <tt>OCTControlRepresentation = control_function_parametrized</tt>
    !% (<tt>OCTScheme</tt> .lt. <tt>oct_algorithm_straight_iteration</tt>).
    !%Option oct_algorithm_zbr98 1 
    !% Backward-Forward-Backward scheme described in <i>JCP</i> <b>108</b>, 1953 (1998).
    !% Only possible if target operator is a projection operator.
    !% Provides fast, stable and monotonic convergence.
    !%Option oct_algorithm_zr98  2
    !% Forward-Backward-Forward scheme described in <i>JCP</i> <b>109</b>, 385 (1998).
    !% Works for projection and more general target operators also. The convergence is 
    !% stable but slower than ZBR98. 
    !% Note that local operators show an extremely slow convergence. It ensures monotonic 
    !% convergence.
    !%Option oct_algorithm_wg05  3
    !% Forward-Backward scheme described in <i>J. Opt. B.</i> <b>7</b>, 300 (2005).
    !% Works for all kinds of target operators, can be used with all kinds of filters, and 
    !% allows a fixed fluence.
    !% The price is a rather unstable convergence. 
    !% If the restrictions set by the filter and fluence are reasonable, a good overlap can be 
    !% expected within 20 iterations.
    !% No monotonic convergence.
    !%Option oct_algorithm_mt03 4
    !% Basically an improved and generalized scheme. 
    !% Comparable to ZBR98/ZR98. See [Y. Maday and G. Turinici, <i>J. Chem. Phys.</i> <b>118</b>, 8191 (2003)].
    !%Option oct_algorithm_krotov 5
    !% The procedure reported in [D. Tannor, V. Kazakov and V.
    !% Orlov, in <i>Time-Dependent Quantum Molecular Dynamics</i>, edited by J. Broeckhove
    !% and L. Lathouweres (Plenum, New York, 1992), pp. 347-360].
    !%Option oct_algorithm_straight_iteration 6
    !% Straight iteration: one forward and one backward propagation is performed at each
    !% iteration, both with the same control field. An output field is calculated with the
    !% resulting wavefunctions. Note that this scheme typically does not converge, unless
    !% some mixing (<tt>OCTMixing = yes</tt>) is used.
    !%Option oct_algorithm_cg 7
    !% Conjugate-gradients, as implemented in the GNU GSL library.
    !%Option oct_algorithm_direct 8
    !% This is a "direct" optimization scheme. This means that we do not make use of the
    !% "usual" QOCT equations (backward-forward propagations, etc), but we use some gradient-free
    !% maximization algorithm for the function that we want to optimize. In this case, the
    !% maximization algorithm is the Nelder-Mead algorithm as implemeted in the GSL. The function
    !% values are obtained by successive forward propagations.
    !%Option oct_algorithm_newuoa 9
    !% This is exactly the same as <tt>oct_algorithm_direct</tt>, except in this case the maximization
    !% algorithm is the so-called NEWUOA algorithm [M. J. D. Powell, <i>IMA J. Numer. Analysis</i>
