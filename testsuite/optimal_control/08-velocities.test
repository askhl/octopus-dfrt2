Test       : QOCT, velocity target
Programs   : octopus
TestGroups : oct
Enabled    : Yes

# This is the test for the velocities target option. The target is defined to break a H2 molecule,
# modelled in 1D, and with independent electrons to simplify things. The initial guess field
# does not break the bond, whereas the final optimized laser pulse does (without any significant
# ionization). The test runs only the first conjugate gradient iteration. After around 40 CG
# iterations, the field, although not converged, is already good enough to break the bond.
