=head1 NAME

oct-rotatory_strength - Calculates the rotatory-strength spectrum from a time-propagation run.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=over

=item B<oct-rotatory_strength>

=back

[oct-rotatory_strength does not read the standard input: all standard
input will be simply ignored. An input file named F<inp> must be
present in the running directory.  Also, oct-rotatory_strength accepts
no command-line arguments, since there is not a standard way to do
this with Fortran 90.]


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program is one of the B<octopus> utilities.

Uses output from a time-propagation run to calculate the rotatory strength,
for circular dichroism or optical rotation.

The man pages of octopus and of the auxiliary octopus
sub-programs (oct-something) are not intended to contain the
documentation of the programs, but only their basic
description. For where to find more documentation, see the
L<SEE ALSO> section below.
