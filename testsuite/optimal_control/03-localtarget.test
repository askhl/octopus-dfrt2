Test       : OCT with local target
Programs   : octopus
TestGroups : long-run, oct
Enabled    : Yes

# The test ensures that the OCT with local target works.
# 
# We do the following intermediate steps:
# First, the two lowest eigenstates of the asymmetric double well,
# V(x) = 1/64*(x)^4-1/4*(x)^2+1/256*(x)^3,
# are calculated. 
# A similar potential is used in Rev Mod (Haenggi, Griffoni)

Input: 03-localtarget.01-gs.inp
match ; Total energy ; GREP(static/info, 'Total       =', 20) ; -0.62061608

# Then, run the optimization for only one iteration and check the convergence.
# Note that this run only converges to a good overlap with
# the target density after a lot of iterations (e.g., if we run over
# 50 iterations we reach J1 = -0.02195, with J1=0 implying perfect
# overlap and J1 = -2 to overlap at all.
# To get a better overlap, increase the quality of the mesh (reduce the grid
# spacing) and/or increase the time interval.
Input: 03-localtarget.02-oct.inp
match ; J1 1st iteration  ; GREP(opt-control/convergence, ' 1  ', 40) ; -0.49521597


# Now, we define the target as a time-dependent target. Also, we use
# the conjugate gradients method for optimization.
Input: 03-localtarget.03-tdoct.inp
match ; J 1st iteration  ; GREP(opt-control/convergence, '##        1', 20) ;  0.36745451


# Now we check that the many-particle version of the QOCT optimization of
# local targets also works.

Input: 03-localtarget.04-gs-mp.inp
match ; Total energy ; GREP(static/info, 'Total       =', 20) ; -2.16891047

# Now once again we run for only one iteration and check the convergence.
Input: 03-localtarget.05-oct-mp.inp
