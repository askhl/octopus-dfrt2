# This test calculates the ground-state of a Na8 cluster, described by
# the spherical-jellium model. The calculation reproduces one of the 
# first calculation of this kind; namely the plot of the density and of
# the total self-consisten potential reproduces Fig. 1 of
# [W. Ekardt, Phys. Rev. B 29, 1558 (1984)].
