=head1 NAME

oct-center-geom - Centers a molecule geometry

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=over

=item B<oct-center-geom>

=back

[oct-center-geom does not read the standard input: all standard input
will be simply ignored. An input file named F<inp> must be present
in the running directory.
Also, oct-center-geom accepts no command line arguments, since there is
not a standard way to do this with Fortran 90.]


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program is one of the B<octopus> utilities.

It reads the xyz file pointed to by the XYZCoordinates variable
in the F<inp> file, and constructs one output xyz file,
that will be called F<adjusted.xyz> file, that describes 
the same system but in which the atomic coordiates are centered.

The man pages of octopus and of the auxiliary octopus
sub-programs (oct-something) are not intended to contain the
documentation of the programs, but only their basic
description. For where to find more documentation, see the
L<SEE ALSO> section below.
