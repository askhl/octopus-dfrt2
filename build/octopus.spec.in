%description
octopus is a computer package aimed at the simulation of the electron-ion 
dynamics of finite systems, both in one and three dimensions, under the 
influence of time-dependent electromagnetic fields. The electronic degrees 
of freedom are treated quantum mechanically within the time-dependent 
Kohn-Sham formalism, while the ions are handled classically. All quantities 
are expanded in a regular mesh in real space, and the simulations are 
performed in real time. Although not optimized for that purpose, the 
program is also able to obtain static properties like ground-state geometries,
or static polarizabilities. The method employed proved quite reliable and 
general, and has been successfully used to calculate linear and non-linear 
absorption spectra, harmonic spectra, laser induced fragmentation, etc. 
of a variety of systems, from small clusters to medium sized quantum dots.
