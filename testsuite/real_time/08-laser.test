Enabled    : Yes

# This test obtains the electronic ground state of a Na_2^+ molecule (the
# nuclei are not in their minimum configuration). Note that there is only
# one electron, since it makes use of pseudopotentials.
#
# Then, it propagates its  evolution under the influence of an electric 
# field in the dipole approximation, first in the length gauge, and then 
# in the velocity gauge.
#
# The test compares the z component of the dipole moment after 0.2 atomic
# units. Note that the energies that will be obtained will not coincide,
# since we are not using a gauge-independent energy expression.
