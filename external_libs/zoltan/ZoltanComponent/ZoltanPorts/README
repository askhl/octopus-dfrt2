This directory contains all the Ports and other interfaces used and
provided by ZoltanComponent. These are all C++ classes with

  i) no private or public data
 ii) no private methods
iii) all public methods are virtual.

The file CONV_NS.h contains a macro. There was a time when all the
cca-specific interfaces (Port and Component) were in namespace gov::cca::.
Currently, they are in classic::gov::cca and in the future there is idle
talk that they might go to neo::gov::cca. Macro'ed it.
